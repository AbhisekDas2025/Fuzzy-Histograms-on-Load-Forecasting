# Fuzzy-Histograms-on-Load-Forecasting
This repository details a hybrid Fuzzy-LSTM for short-term load forecasting (STLF). By using fuzzy feature engineering and Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering, the model better captures uncertainties in power data, achieving a 22.2% RMSE reduction and a significant accuracy boost over a baseline LSTM on the Tetouan City dataset.
